# Cheese Chase

### Description
An iOS puzzle game I worked on back in 2015

The goal of the game is to pick up all the cheese and exit through the hole without being caught by the cat.
For every one space you move, the cat can move 2. You need to use the barriers to your advantage, as the cat will only make moves that bring it closer to you. It will not attempt to go around the barrier.
